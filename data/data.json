is a powerhouse of product strategy.

In each project, he knew exactly when to balance giving the team direction vs. asking for it, and was an open but knowledgeable collaborator who always sought first to understand the point of view being shared. I really appreciated his depth of knowledge but almost as much his patience; he can work through a thorny, unknown challenge with a team and remain not only focused on the problem, but on getting there calmly and as a team, and it show in the results. He's clearly an expert on mobile, and the ecosystems, services, products, and players that define the space, but his natural curiosity means that he is constantly exploring new insights into consumer behavior and the product/services implications that result. I'd welcome the chance to work with him again.","created":"2016-07-25 18:33:06","last_updated":"2016-10-08 13:35:32","deleted":1},{"id":16673700,"member_id":7197719,"recommendation":"Ed is an entrepreneurial manager with a strong business sense and creativity.

It is extremely rewarding to work alongside others and identify and remove obstacles that stand in the way of progress. A career in supply chain has given me a steady supply of problems to solve and I've been blessed to work with incredible partners as we aim to unlock better.\n\nMy first professional experience in supply chain came with an Industrial Engineering internship at Ryder Logistics back in 2011. That experience lit the flame for me and opened my eyes to what a career in supply chain could offer. I spent seven years with Target Corporation, working in a number of site leadership and headquarters support roles as we built out Target's automated grocery supply chain. I joined Walmart in December 2018 as an Assistant General Manager of Walmart's first automated consolidation center in Colton, CA. Today, I am a Senior Site Engineer working to build out the Engineering arm of the Walmart Consolidation network.\n\nOutside of work, I take every opportunity to get out in nature and explore the wonderful hiking trails in the mountains of southern California. These trips challenge me physically like my work challenges me intellectually. In both arenas, there are problems to be solved and challenges to be overcome, but a great reward to be gained in the struggle.","connections":"500+

We had interviewed several candidates, when Damon asked if we might consider him. Although initially taken aback, on reflection I decided Damon would be an ideal leader for our small software endeavor and convinced my partner of the wisdom of this choice. Damon performed exceptionally well. He took complete control of the corporation which we formed, filing necessary paperwork, contracting with software developers and handling all of the finances.\n\nDamon has made conscious decisions to excel. Damon is who he is because he carefully chose his path and worked extraordinarily hard at achieving his goals. He has consistently exercised discipline, determination and distinction in his actions, both academic and personal. It is by dint of his demeanor, his intelligence, and his ability that he has risen to the level he has attained at Microsoft.

I helped leaders and teams across Alphabet/Google and beyond to discover and solve problems in new, unconventional ways, shaping one of the world's most fabled innovation cultures.\n\nAs an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (aka: d.school), I teach graduate courses like: “Hacking your Innovation Mindset” and feel lucky to empower students through design so that they can invent cool things that matter in the world.\n\nFeatured as the \"Pope of Creativity\" and \"Dr. Innovation\" in over two hundred international newspapers, magazines and documentaries like FastCompany, Inc. Magazine, Times Magazine, Harvard Business Manager, WirtschaftsWoche, El Tiempo, Business Today, FAZ, Asia Business Daily, Der Spiegel, Financial Times, Capital, Manager Magazine, brandeins, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Chosun Ilbo, The Telegraph, Arte TV, VOX TV and ARD.\n\nTogether with my wonderful wife, we support our next generation of inventors as the founders of our children's charity and maker space: “Tüftelei”, where children use their human superpower to imagine and learn with their minds, hands and hearts.\n\nFinding inspiration in the playfulness and explorer mindset of my three children, you'll find me regularly evangelizing how people can grow their mind to invent what's next around the world and from my GeoDesic Dome above Silicon Valley.","connections":"500+
